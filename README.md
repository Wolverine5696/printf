		Design a printf as a Group Project
		==================================
			<Description>
this is the printf project where Sam and Malik join forces to develop a printf function in the C coding language. The purpose is not entirely to make a better printf, more than it is to learn how the function actually works by developing the basis of the function for this project, the problems presented, and the teamwork to accomplish a few goals with the function.
