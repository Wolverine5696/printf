this is the printf project where Sam and Malik join forces to develop a printf function!
the purpose is not entirely to make a better printf, more than it is to learn how the function actually works by developing the basis of the function for this project. but, that does not mean either holberton student can't use this in development in the future of software design given the fact that there is a need for memory allocation in object oriented programming in a higher languages which the printf function provides.

Where to start?! -- First the easy part. RtFM! -- so we can search out the parameters we need for this project, as well as other information we need for the project.But this also allows us to both learn about the printf function given the main.h and the actual function in mind. But also, format -- the readability of the program and the use of the funcion will be purposeful in the coding process.

Also, this project is a little bit of an opportunity getting to work with others. gitpod.io and the use of visual code is an asset to really developing projects with others in the future.
