this is the printf project where Sam and Malik join forces to develop a printf function!
the purpose is not entirely to make a better printf, more than it is to learn how the function actually works by developing the basis of the function. but, that does not mean either holberton student can't use this in development in the future of software design
this will be fun
this is a project where Sam and Malik join forces at holberton to create a printf function with an ellipse for parameters
